## Answer

Meta has agreed to buy 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD's artificial intelligence chips in a deal valued at more than $100 billion, which could result in Meta owning as much as 10% of AMD’s stock. This deal represents a significant move by Meta to secure its AI infrastructure and positions AMD as a key player in the AI chip market. Meanwhile, industrial investment in AI and data centers surged by nearly a third last year, with the United States leading the investment surge, while China's investment slumped further. Additionally, China's brain-computer interface industry is rapidly advancing, supported by strong policy and substantial funding.
